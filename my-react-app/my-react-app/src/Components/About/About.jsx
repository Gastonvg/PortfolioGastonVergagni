üöÄ My passion is to continue developing myself as a Full Stack Developer. I'm fascinated by learning new technologies and tackling new challenges. I excel in both backend and frontend development, although working on the frontend excites me more. One of my strengths is that I love solving problems. Where someone sees frustration, I see excitement and an opportunity to improve my skills.

üë®‚Äçüéì I started studying programming in 2020, initially with a bit of Python. In 2023, I discovered JavaScript and web development, which led me to pursue a career as a Full Stack Developer. Currently, I have knowledge in JS, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, SQL, and Python.

ü§ù I've had the opportunity to work in teams on numerous occasions throughout my career as a Full Stack Developer and in my previous role as a technical support specialist in systems. This experience has allowed me to acquire a wide range of soft skills, such as effective communication, adaptability to changes, and empathy. I am very cheerful and predisposed to helping others.</p>
